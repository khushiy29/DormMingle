# DormMingle
 A platform to speed up the process of room allocation in universities where hostel rooms are alloted via offline process. With this platform, colleges will be able to on board all the students on a common ground and the students will be able to select the room of their choice with many custom options. Moreover, the paring of roommate can also be customized, either by providing a secret key to one another to pair up or a random roommate. This project demonstrates the use of Data Structures and Algorithms to map and solve real life scenarios. This is the drafted demonstration only. The work is in progress.
